# Library-management-
this system used to manage libraries in colleges and help librarians to check out books and students who took books and returned books , also the system has roles for admins like manager and employee , each role does a different work , an employee can't do managers work in the system .  the system built by me , i used C# for front and design and sql server for backend.
